# Agri_Food_CO2_Emission
# Introduction

Carbon dioxide emissions from the agri-food sector contribute a substantial portion of the global annual emissions, and are significant when studying climate change. It is important to understand the environmental impact of the food industry. One relevant aspect is to understand the spatial distribution and the temporal trends of emission from the agri-food sector. 

# Key Questions 

Which countries have the highest/lowest CO2 emission from the agri-food sector ?

Which countries have the highest/lowest per capita CO2 emission from the agri-food sector ?

What trend does the global CO2 emission from the agrifood sector show?

What trend does the global per capita CO2 emission from the agri-food sector show?

What is the relationship between total/per capita CO2 emission, and the change in local average temperature?
